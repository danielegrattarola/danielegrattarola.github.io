I had the pleasure of being a guest on [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLtBahI5DMrt0NPvDSoIRQ) to chat about cellular automata, emergence, life, the universe, and my own work on [graph neural cellular automata](https://danielegrattarola.github.io/posts/2021-11-08/graph-neural-cellular-automata.html).

I had a great time with Tim and Keith, they are doing an incredible work with the podcast and it's really an honor to having been a part of it.

Enjoy!
