I was featured for the second time on [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLtBahI5DMrt0NPvDSoIRQ).

This interview was shot at NeurIPS 2023 last year, I mostly talked about our work on 
[generalized implicit neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15674) from my time at EPFL.

Cheers!
